ForgotPassword Feature:
I created an account (see on photo 'signup2' and 'account_created') and afterward, I accessed the forgot password page.
Despite entering wrong credentials,with only the SSN being correct (picture 'wrong credentials correct ssn number'),
to my surprise, my account was found. We do not have the documentation,but we are sure that there is a bug because
it is not normal to locate an account without all the correct credentials,especially since all fields are mandatory.
Instead of being met with an error message, I was redirected to the information page. It seems like the system was able
to locate my account despite the incorrect information provided during the password recovery process.
